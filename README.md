# WineApp

`WineApp` is a generic app that can be used by wineries & breweries to do beer and wine tastings.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

`WineApp` requires [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to install and run. NPM comes with nodejs, so once you have node downloaded and installed you are good to go. To verify they are installed you can run:
```
node -v
```
```
npm -v
```

### Installing

Once you have the NodeJS environment set up, clone the repository to your local machine, `cd` into the cloned folder and run `npm i` to install the dependencies. To start the express server and test the app, run `npm run start` and then navigate to `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.
