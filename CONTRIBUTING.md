## Code of Conduct

The FourMuskateers project asks that each member be courteous and apply common sense as one would when working in a professional environment.

## [Issues](https://github.com/tlburchh/FourMuskateers/projects/1)

Issues in `WineApp` are the primary means by which bug reports and
general discussions are made.

Each issue which exists under the project tab -> WineApp should follow a specific tagging scheme based on what kind of issue it is. Each issue must be prefixed with brackets ([]) containing one of the icebox names, shortened to the beginning letter(s), followed by the specific issue category, using dot notation. For example: 

[FE.css] - Add basic styling to the landing page

or 

[BE.routing] - Define the routes for the app's API

Github labels should be added appropriately.
